  <p>Can cloud computing infrastructures provide HPC-competitive
                   performance for scientific applications broadly? Despite
                   prolific related literature, this question remains open.
                   Answers are crucial for designing future systems and
                   democratizing high-performance computing. We present a
                   multi-level approach to investigate the performance gap
                   between HPC and cloud computing, isolating different
                   variables that contribute to this gap. Our experiments are
                   divided into (i) hardware and system microbenchmarks and
                   (ii) user application proxies. The results show that today’s
                   high-end cloud computing can deliver HPC-competitive
                   performance not only for computationally intensive
                   applications but also for memory- and
                   communication-intensive applications - at least at modest
                   scales - thanks to the high-speed memory systems and
                   interconnects and dedicated batch scheduling now available
                   on some cloud platforms.</p>
